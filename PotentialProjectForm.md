#### Another way to approach this project is to think situationally. What situations do technical writers in your desired field tend to be responding to? How might we replicate this situation in the context of our class?
Tech Writers can respond to recalls, failures, and/or upgraded.

#### Beyond your desired field or industry, what situations -- professional, academic, even personal -- are you currently involved in that might need the work of a technical writer? For example, maybe your job doesn't have an employee manual, but really is in need of one. Or, maybe there is a manual but its 25 years old.
I am not currently involved in any actives the require technical writing, except Technical Writing class.
